2022-08-20,The Devil All the Time,2020,https://boxd.it/39iPPv,1,,"I watch a lot of movies and it's seldom I turn them off, but I did with this one. Just halfway through when Robert Pattinson's wanted a girl to strip in his car for God's sake. Now I'm an devoted atheist, but even for me this was made in poor taste. It makes the Christians seem so unnecessarily evil. It's also so brutal and depressing for no good reason. During this watch, I just realized how boring it is to watch violence when there is no ""reason"" for it, no goals, just misery. And the way all their parents got killed off seemed contrived, especially the last one. I can handle a lot of violence and gore and a nilistic plot, but I feel a movie needs to earn that stuff, and this certaintly did not. Fine actors though. ",,

I adore the film-making-sequence where the main guy is rushing to collect a camera before the sun sets and all the chaos that ensues. It was soooo over the top and so magical. That sequence alone is worth the watch. The music is catchy, the cinematography is film-like, as if it's drawing upon old cinema, and Brad Pitt is just getting better. All of it together makes for a great ride. I didn't really care for the plot with Dracula-Tobey. Though I love the actor, it just felt random and unnecessary. The reason I'm not giving it a four or five stars is because I think it is a bit of a lacklustre. It's weird, because I love almost every scene individually, but strung together it doesn't do it for me. How Margot Robbie's character ended was a bit underwhelming, and the Cinema Paradiso ending... I want to say it was forced in and a bit unearned... But  actually it works for me. In fact I think I love it. The main guy has a really nice arc from adoring filmmaking to conquering it to having to leave it all behind. Then he returns to the cinema and it's just a really beautiful moment.

Tldr: Every scene by it self is great, but I just didn't care much for the story as a whole.",,2022-12-12

This was such a great watch. I can't remember watching something this epic in cinema, and I have no difficulty in saying this will be the best film of 2024. It starts out surprisingly light-hearted and is quite funny at moments. This ""relatively"" calm start is much needed after the first one... and also within this film considering where it goes. Lots of great performances, but my favorite had to be Javier Bardem as Stilgar. He managed to portray a fanatic religious follower, a funny guy, and a leader all at the same time. I'm so glad that Paul didn't have to challenge and kill him to take his spot at the southern meeting. And from that scene on,  where Paul claims his messiah prophecy, I was sweating in my seat scene after scene until the movie ended! It was an intense and immersive experience that had me cheering for Paul like I was Stilgar. It's a satisfying climax that pays off all the set-up from the first one, and in all the stuff that happens in this movie it even manages to foreshadow a lot of different things for an even greater conflict for part 3.
